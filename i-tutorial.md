# I. 入門指南[^1]

Welcome to thePostgreSQLTutorial. The following few chapters are intended to give a simple introduction toPostgreSQL, relational database concepts, and the SQL language to those who are new to any one of these aspects. We only assume some general knowledge about how to use computers. No particular Unix or programming experience is required. This part is mainly intended to give you some hands-on experience with important aspects of thePostgreSQLsystem. It makes no attempt to be a complete or thorough treatment of the topics it covers.

After you have worked through this tutorial you might want to move on to reading[Part II](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql.html)to gain a more formal knowledge of the SQL language, or[Part IV](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/client-interfaces.html)for information about developing applications forPostgreSQL. Those who set up and manage their own server should also read[Part III](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/admin.html).
