# 51.56. pg\_trigger

The catalog `pg_trigger` stores triggers on tables and views. See [CREATE TRIGGER](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-createtrigger.html) for more information.

**Table 51.56. `pg_trigger` Columns**

| Name | Type | References | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `oid` | `oid` |  | Row identifier \(hidden attribute; must be explicitly selected\) |
| `tgrelid` | `oid` | [`pg_class`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-class.html).oid | The table this trigger is on |
| `tgname` | `name` |  | Trigger name \(must be unique among triggers of same table\) |
| `tgfoid` | `oid` | [`pg_proc`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-proc.html).oid | The function to be called |
| `tgtype` | `int2` |  | Bit mask identifying trigger firing conditions |
| `tgenabled` | `char` |  | Controls in which [session\_replication\_role](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SESSION-REPLICATION-ROLE) modes the trigger fires. `O` = trigger fires in “origin” and “local” modes, `D` = trigger is disabled, `R` = trigger fires in “replica” mode, `A` = trigger fires always. |
| `tgisinternal` | `bool` |  | True if trigger is internally generated \(usually, to enforce the constraint identified by `tgconstraint`\) |
| `tgconstrrelid` | `oid` | [`pg_class`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-class.html).oid | The table referenced by a referential integrity constraint |
| `tgconstrindid` | `oid` | [`pg_class`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-class.html).oid | The index supporting a unique, primary key, referential integrity, or exclusion constraint |
| `tgconstraint` | `oid` | [`pg_constraint`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-constraint.html).oid | The `pg_constraint` entry associated with the trigger, if any |
| `tgdeferrable` | `bool` |  | True if constraint trigger is deferrable |
| `tginitdeferred` | `bool` |  | True if constraint trigger is initially deferred |
| `tgnargs` | `int2` |  | Number of argument strings passed to trigger function |
| `tgattr` | `int2vector` | [`pg_attribute`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-attribute.html).attnum | Column numbers, if trigger is column-specific; otherwise an empty array |
| `tgargs` | `bytea` |  | Argument strings to pass to trigger, each NULL-terminated |
| `tgqual` | `pg_node_tree` |  | Expression tree \(in `nodeToString()` representation\) for the trigger's `WHEN` condition, or null if none |
| `tgoldtable` | `name` |  | `REFERENCING` clause name for `OLD TABLE`, or null if none |
| `tgnewtable` | `name` |  | `REFERENCING` clause name for `NEW TABLE`, or null if none |

Currently, column-specific triggering is supported only for `UPDATE` events, and so `tgattr` is relevant only for that event type. `tgtype` might contain bits for other event types as well, but those are presumed to be table-wide regardless of what is in `tgattr`.

## Note

When `tgconstraint` is nonzero, `tgconstrrelid`, `tgconstrindid`, `tgdeferrable`, and `tginitdeferred` are largely redundant with the referenced `pg_constraint` entry. However, it is possible for a non-deferrable trigger to be associated with a deferrable constraint: foreign key constraints can have some deferrable and some non-deferrable triggers.

## Note

`pg_class.relhastriggers` must be true if a relation has any triggers in this catalog.
