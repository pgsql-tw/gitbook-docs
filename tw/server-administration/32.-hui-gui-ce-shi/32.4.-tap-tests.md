# 33.4. TAP Tests

Various tests, particularly the client program tests under `src/bin`, use the Perl TAP tools and are run using the Perl testing program `prove`. You can pass command-line options to `prove`by setting the `make` variable `PROVE_FLAGS`, for example:

```text
make -C src/bin check PROVE_FLAGS='--timer'
```

See the manual page of `prove` for more information.

The TAP tests require the Perl module `IPC::Run`. This module is available from CPAN or an operating system package.
