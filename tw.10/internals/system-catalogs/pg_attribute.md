# 51.7. pg\_attribute

The catalog `pg_attribute` stores information about table columns. There will be exactly one `pg_attribute` row for every column in every table in the database. \(There will also be attribute entries for indexes, and indeed all objects that have `pg_class` entries.\)

The term attribute is equivalent to column and is used for historical reasons.

**Table 51.7. `pg_attribute` Columns**

| Name | Type | References | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `attrelid` | `oid` | [`pg_class`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-class.html).oid | The table this column belongs to |
| `attname` | `name` |   | The column name |
| `atttypid` | `oid` | [`pg_type`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-type.html).oid | The data type of this column |
| `attstattarget` | `int4` |   | `attstattarget` controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column by [ANALYZE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-analyze.html). A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A negative value says to use the system default statistics target. The exact meaning of positive values is data type-dependent. For scalar data types, `attstattarget` is both the target number of “most common values” to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create. |
| `attlen` | `int2` |   | A copy of `pg_type.typlen` of this column's type |
| `attnum` | `int2` |   | The number of the column. Ordinary columns are numbered from 1 up. System columns, such as `oid`, have \(arbitrary\) negative numbers. |
| `attndims` | `int4` |   | Number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise 0. \(Presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means “it's an array”.\) |
| `attcacheoff` | `int4` |   | Always -1 in storage, but when loaded into a row descriptor in memory this might be updated to cache the offset of the attribute within the row |
| `atttypmod` | `int4` |   | `atttypmod` records type-specific data supplied at table creation time \(for example, the maximum length of a `varchar` column\). It is passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. The value will generally be -1 for types that do not need `atttypmod`. |
| `attbyval` | `bool` |   | A copy of `pg_type.typbyval` of this column's type |
| `attstorage` | `char` |   | Normally a copy of `pg_type.typstorage` of this column's type. For TOAST-able data types, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy. |
| `attalign` | `char` |   | A copy of `pg_type.typalign` of this column's type |
| `attnotnull` | `bool` |   | This represents a not-null constraint. |
| `atthasdef` | `bool` |   | This column has a default value, in which case there will be a corresponding entry in the `pg_attrdef` catalog that actually defines the value. |
| `attidentity` | `char` |   | If a zero byte \(`''`\), then not an identity column. Otherwise, `a` = generated always, `d` = generated by default. |
| `attisdropped` | `bool` |   | This column has been dropped and is no longer valid. A dropped column is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via SQL. |
| `attislocal` | `bool` |   | This column is defined locally in the relation. Note that a column can be locally defined and inherited simultaneously. |
| `attinhcount` | `int4` |   | The number of direct ancestors this column has. A column with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed. |
| `attcollation` | `oid` | [`pg_collation`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/catalog-pg-collation.html).oid | The defined collation of the column, or zero if the column is not of a collatable data type. |
| `attacl` | `aclitem[]` |   | Column-level access privileges, if any have been granted specifically on this column |
| `attoptions` | `text[]` |   | Attribute-level options, as “keyword=value” strings |
| `attfdwoptions` | `text[]` |   | Attribute-level foreign data wrapper options, as “keyword=value” strings |

In a dropped column's `pg_attribute` entry, `atttypid` is reset to zero, but `attlen` and the other fields copied from `pg_type` are still valid. This arrangement is needed to cope with the situation where the dropped column's data type was later dropped, and so there is no `pg_type` row anymore. `attlen` and the other fields can be used to interpret the contents of a row of the table.
